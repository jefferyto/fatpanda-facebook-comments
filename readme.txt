Replace WordPress commenting with the Facebook Comments widget, quickly and easily.

== Description ==

This plugin is a drop-in solution for replacing the default WordPress commenting 
with the [Facebook Comments widget](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/).
It is far-and-away the easiest to use plugin available - just try it and see! Check it out:

* Zero configuration to get it working - just install and activate to replace standard commenting
* Imports all Facebook comments into your WordPress database for safe-keeping (you'll need a [Facebook Application](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/))
* If you use [SharePress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sharepress), you already have a Facebook Application - no need to register a second one!
* Supports XID for maximum compatability with existing Facebook Comment installations
* Automatically imports settings from [Facebook Comments for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facebook-comments-for-wordpress/)!
* Comments are printed in hidden `<noscript>` blocks to maximize SEO

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin.

2. Activate the plugin.

3. Optionally, go to Settings / Facebook Comments, and configure the plugin to your liking.
